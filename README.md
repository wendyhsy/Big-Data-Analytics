# Big-Data-Analytics - Bitcoin Cypto Price Prediction

Cryptocurrency is storming the world, and many supporters are racing to buy them now before it becomes more valuable. Because of its volatility, there is a high demand to try and predict what the prices will look like in the future. This project will look into time series forecasting with cryptocurrency prices, and allow users to see potential trends in the cryptocurrency market. This is a project inspired by the [G-Research Crypto forecasting competition](link), where participants have the challenge to predict prices returns across a bundle of major cryptocurrencies. 

The goal for this project was to apply big data analytics technics to clean large data sets, perform timeseries anaysis, and train neural network models to predict price movements.

There are **6 main parts** to this project:
1. Data Cleaning of Bitcoin Prices Data Set and Bitcoin Twitter Sentiment
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 
3. ARIMA Time Series Analysis of the Price
4. Neural Networking Prediction of the Price using the Twitter Volume and Twitter Sentiment
5. Challenges/Obstacles Faced
